# acmd-generator-formatted
Modified Data Viewer to ACMD converter that formats the output.
Exact same as the standard data_viewer_to_acmd.py that's found in the code-mod-framework except it formats the output.
The input MUST be 'data_viewer.txt' and the output will always be 'acmd.txt'. To run the script just double-click the script.
